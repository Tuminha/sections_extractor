4. conclusion
In this study, n-HA/CS composite membranes with different n-HA/ CS ratios were prepared through solvent casting and evaporation methods. SEM, FTIR, XRD, swelling measurement and mechanical test were applied to investigate the effects of n-HA content and solvent evaporation temperature on physical and chemical properties of the  composite membranes. The results indicate that the surface of the composite membranes is rough and microporous, suitable for adhesion, crawl and growth of cells. The hydroxyapatite holds nano size in the composite membranes and its Ca ions and -OH groups can interact with -NH 2 or -OH groups of CS. The n-HA content and solvent evaporation temperature have obvious influence on the swelling ratio, the tensile strength and the elongation rate of composite membranes. Cell culture and MTT assays show that n-HA/CS composite membranes have no cytotoxic effect on cells and possess good biocompatibility. Therefore, the n-HA/CS composite membranes may have good prospect in future GBR membrane applications.
